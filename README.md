**ATM Machine Project (Java)**

This project is a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) developed using Java. It incorporates key features of a real-world ATM system, providing an interactive experience for users to manage their banking transactions. The application supports the following functionalities:

Account Creation: Users can create a new account by setting up an initial balance and personal details.

**Account Balance Check:** Users can check their current account balance in real-time, providing a clear overview of their financial status.

**Deposit Funds:** Users can deposit money into their account with the ability to track changes in the balance.

**Withdraw Funds:** Users can withdraw money from their account, with built-in validation to ensure sufficient balance for withdrawals.

**Transaction History:** The system maintains a record of all deposits and withdrawals, allowing users to review their financial activity.

This project highlights the use of object-oriented programming principles such as classes, methods, and data encapsulation, ensuring the system is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
